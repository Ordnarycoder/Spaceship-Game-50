# Space Ship Game

A simple arcade-style spaceship game built with Python and Pygame. In this game, you control a spaceship that can move around the screen and shoot bullets to destroy falling meteors. The game tracks your score, and the game ends if a meteor collides with the spaceship.

## Features

- **Smooth Movement:** Control the spaceship using arrow keys.
- **Shooting Mechanic:** Press the spacebar to fire bullets (with a cooldown to prevent rapid fire).
- **Meteor Spawning:** Meteors spawn randomly from the top of the screen.
- **Collision Detection:** Bullets destroy meteors and increase your score. A collision between a meteor and the spaceship ends the game.
- **Score Display:** Your current score is shown in the top left corner.
